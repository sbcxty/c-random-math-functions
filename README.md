Creating and using functions in C, including built-in math functions and random number generation.

Instructions
Create a program that performs the following tasks using functions:

Generates 5 random floating-point numbers between 0 and 100.
For each number, compute and display:
Its square root
Its sine and cosine
Its rounded value to the nearest integer

Use the following concepts:
rand() and srand() for random number generation
<math.h> functions like sqrt(), sin(), cos(), and round()
Custom functions to organize your code (e.g., a function to generate a random number, a function to compute and display results)

Sample Output:
Random Number: 45.67
Square Root: 6.76
Sine: 0.72
Cosine: 0.69
Rounded: 46

Random Number: 12.34
Square Root: 3.51
Sine: 0.22
Cosine: 0.97
Rounded: 12
